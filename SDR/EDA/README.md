##Splendor Analytics: Exploratory Data Analysis Report

#Introduction:
Splendor Analytics is dedicated to providing valuable insights into the demographics, preferences, and behavior of students using our platform. In this report, we present the findings of an exploratory analysis conducted on our student database, aiming to uncover patterns and trends that can inform decision-making and improve user experience.
Data:
The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing information on student demographics, preferences, and engagement metrics. The dataset includes the following key variables:
- Age Group
- Availability for Classes
- Country/Location
- Preferred SQL Database by Experience Level
- Percentage of Unemployed Students
- SQL Experience Level Distribution
- Month of Student Registration
- Number of Students by Experience Level
- Topic of Interest (Optional): this column was excised from the data due to inconsistencies with the data 
#Analysis:
After careful Data cleaning and data standardization using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (Scripts shared in the readme file) the following was observed.
a.	Number of Students by Age Group:
	The age group 25-29 exhibits the highest enrolment, with 608 students, followed closely by the 21-24 age group, comprising 415 students. This indicates a significant portion of our student population falls within these age brackets.
b.	Availability for Classes:
 	Evening classes on both weekdays and weekends attract the highest number of students, indicating a preference for flexibility in scheduling. Weekdays evenings have 322 students, while weekends evenings have 519 students enrolled.
c.	Number of Students by Country/Location:
	Nigeria stands out as the dominant location with 1383 students, accounting for 85.58% of the total. Other countries such as the United Kingdom, Ghana, and Kenya also have notable representation, showcasing the platform's global reach.
d.	Preferred SQL Database by Experience Level:
MySQL emerges as the preferred SQL database across all experience levels, with the highest number of students. However, PostgreSQL and SQL Server also garner significant usage among beginners and intermediates, indicating a diverse user base
e.	Percentage of Students Who Are Unemployed:
 	Approximately 6% of our total student population, accounting for 97 students, are currently unemployed. This insight could guide the development of tailored career resources and job placement services.
f.	SQL Experience Level Distribution:
	Beginners constitute the majority of our student base, comprising 79.15% of the total. This highlights the importance of providing introductory content and support to meet the needs of novice learners.
g.	Students Registered by Month:
 	December 2023 witnessed the highest influx of student registrations, totaling 1506, followed by January 2024 with 110 registrations. This trend may reflect seasonal patterns or marketing efforts during specific periods.
h.	Number of Students by Experience Level:
 	Beginners represent the largest segment of our student population, with 1279 students, followed by intermediates and advanced students. This distribution underscores the importance of catering to diverse skill levels in our educational content.

#Recommendations:
1. Enhance Course Flexibility: Given the high enrolment in evening classes, consider expanding the availability of courses during these times to accommodate the preferences of a significant portion of our student base. Additionally, offering more flexible scheduling options, such as on-demand or self-paced courses, could further enhance accessibility and cater to diverse learning styles.
2. Localized Content and Support: With Nigeria being the dominant location, explore opportunities to provide localized content, support resources, and community engagement initiatives tailored to the needs and interests of students in this region. This localization strategy can help foster a sense of belonging and improve overall engagement. Also, a proper study should be carried out to cater to the time difference in all locations and enhance the platforms global reach.
3. Diversify SQL Database Content: While MySQL is the preferred SQL database across all experience levels, consider diversifying the course offerings to include more content on alternative databases such as SQL Server, PostgreSQL and Oracle. This approach would cater to the varied preferences and career objectives of our student population, ensuring comprehensive coverage of relevant skills in the industry.
4. Career Development Resources: Recognizing that approximately 6% of our students are unemployed, prioritize the development of career development resources, including job placement assistance, resume building workshops, and networking opportunities. By empowering students with the necessary skills and support to enter or advance in the workforce, we can enhance the platform's value proposition and contribute to the long-term success of our users.
5. Continuous Skill-Level Assessment: Implement regular assessments or quizzes within courses to gauge students' proficiency levels and tailor content accordingly. This personalized approach to learning can help address gaps in knowledge, accelerate skill development, and maintain engagement by providing relevant and challenging material based on individual progress.
6. Promote Early-Year Registrations: Capitalize on the trend of high student registrations in December by launching targeted marketing campaigns or promotional offers during this period to incentivize early-year registrations. By encouraging students to enrol at the beginning of the year, we can ensure a steady influx of new users and maintain momentum throughout the year.
#Conclusion:
These recommendations aim to address key insights gleaned from the exploratory analysis and support the overarching goal of enhancing the performance and effectiveness of the Splendor Analytics learning platform. By implementing these strategic initiatives, we can better meet the evolving needs of our diverse student community, foster engagement, and facilitate continuous skill development and career advancement opportunities.
This proactive approach to platform optimization underscores our commitment to delivering exceptional value to our users and solidifying Splendor Analytics as a premier destination for online learning across various domains.
